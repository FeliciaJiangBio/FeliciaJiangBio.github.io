## Abstract
When the alternative splicing event result in different mature mRNA translated in the cell and diverse protein isoforms produced, they tend to affect disordered protein domains, which are often involved in functionally important protein–protein interactions. Protein isoforms can also have differences in stability, localization, enzymatic activity and protein–nucleic acid interactions. The extent to which alternative splicing affects protein and/or cell function or, rather, represents a by-product of transcriptome noise is unclear. Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancer for women worldwide. Current studies categorize the breast cancer into several subtypes according to different receptors and will treat with different clinical methods. The heterogeneity of the breast cancer causes this distinct survival outcome difference, and alternative splicing is one of the mechanisms of the heterogeneity. In this study, a comprehensive survey of protein isoform structures in breast cancer tissue was conducted by integrating multiple omics. 90298 was annotated and filtered by integrating long-read RNAseq transcriptome analysis and short-read RNAseq. 79815 ORFs were identified using Ribosome profiling in total. Ultimately, 46202 protein isoforms were kept and predicted structures with AlphaFold2. The "3Diso-TransFold" pipeline constructing the “3DisoGalaxy” protein structural similarity network based on multiple structure alignment scores with evaluated translated ORFs and obtained isoform structures. ORFs from the master transcriptome were retained only if identified by Ribo-seq, supporting their translation. The network reveals breast cancer and TNBC-specific isoforms, enabling subtype-specific therapeutic screening and validation.

# 3DisoGalaxy & 3DisoTranFold
The pipeline <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1eaeaf5c-081d-4d76-b816-bca55d979ad3" width="100"> [https://github.com/CityUHK-CompBio/TranStructomics](https://github.com/CityUHK-CompBio/3Diso-TransFold), was used to evaluate translation ORFs and predict isoform structures across transcriptome-identified transcripts, ultimately constructing a protein structural similarity network, “3DisoGalaxy,” based on multiple structure alignment scores comparing isoform structures. Specifically, the predicted ORFs from the master transcriptome were retained only if identified by Ribo-seq analysis, supporting their participation in the translation process.  




By combining BLASTP and HMMER methods, ORF sequences were predicted using TransDecoder and machine learning. After filtering out low-confidence and short ORFs, the longest ORF sequence was kept for each isoform, and AlphaFold-2.3 was utilized to predict protein structures. Structural similarity was then calculated using the TMalign method, collecting pairwise isoform similarities to construct a “protein universe.” Additionally, functional domains and GO term pathway annotations were assigned to the network based on UniProtKB databases.  

Through the final network, the landscape of cancer-specific alternative splicing-induced protein isoforms becomes available, allowing for the screening and validation of subtype-specific isoforms for therapeutic applications.

## How to use this repository and Quick Start

TORFs from the master transcriptome were retained only if identified by Ribo-seq, supporting their translation. Using BLASTP, HMMER, and machine learning, ORFs were predicted with TransDecoder, and after filtering low-confidence and short ORFs, the longest sequence per isoform was kept. AlphaFold-2.3 predicted protein structures, and TMalign calculated pairwise isoform similarities to build a “protein universe,” with functional domains and GO terms annotated from UniProtKB. The network reveals cancer-specific isoforms, enabling subtype-specific therapeutic screening and validation. To orient users [documentation overview].
