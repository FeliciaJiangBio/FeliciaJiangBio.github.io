I am a 2nd-year PhD candidate at the Department of Surgery ([https://www.med.cuhk.edu.hk/](https://www.surgery.cuhk.edu.hk/), CUHK Medical School, where I develop computation pipelines and machine learning approaches for cancer genomics under the supervision of [Prof. Xin WANG](https://xinwlab.netlify.app/). My research focuses on:

- **Tumor Heterogeneity Analysis**: Specifically, tumor alternative splicing-induced protein isoform large-scale foldome analysis.
- **Biomarker Discovery**: Through integrative multi-omics approaches.
- **Clinical Predictive Modeling**: Utilizing deep learning architectures.
- **Computation-aided Drug Design**: Developing reconstruction algorithms and methods for computation-aided drug (molecules and antibody) screening and design.
