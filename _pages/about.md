I am a 2nd-year PhD candidate at the Department of Surgery ([https://www.med.cuhk.edu.hk/](https://www.surgery.cuhk.edu.hk/), CUHK Medical School, where I develop computation pipelines and machine learning approaches for cancer genomics under the supervision of [Prof. Xin WANG](https://xinwlab.netlify.app/). My research focuses on:

- **Large-scale Protein Structure Analysis**: Proficient in AlphaFold2/3, RoseTTAFold, ColabFold, Foldseek, and ESM-2 for large-scale protein structure prediction and analysis. Focus on protein structural evolution across genome–transcriptome–proteome layers, especially isoform-level inference.

- **Multi-omics Tumor Heterogeneity Analysis**: Focus on splicing-driven protein isoform foldome analysis in cancer. Integrate long-read transcriptome, short-read RNA-seq, Ribo-seq, and PacBio-based genome analysis to study tumor complexity.

- **Biomarker Discovery**: Discover robust biomarkers through integrative multi-omics analysis, combining genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and structural data.

- **Clinical Predictive Modeling**: Build deep learning models for clinical prediction tasks, including patient stratification, metastasis risk, and drug response.

- **Computation-aided Drug Design**: Experienced in molecular docking and simulation using Schrödinger, AutoDock Vina, Rosetta, HDOCK, GROMACS, and CHARMM-GUI. Focus on antibody modeling, drug screening, and protein–ligand interaction analysis.

### Hobbies & Interests

Outside of my research, I enjoy **swimming**, **fitness**, and **reading**. 

I also have a keen interest in critical thinking and fostering interdisciplinary communication and collaboration.
I warmly welcome potential collaborations or interdisciplinary discussions. Please feel free to reach out **if you are interested in my research** or would like to invite me for **a talk or academic exchange.**
