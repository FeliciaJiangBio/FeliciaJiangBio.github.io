I am a 2nd-year PhD candidate at the Department of Surgery([https://www.med.cuhk.edu.hk/](https://www.surgery.cuhk.edu.hk/), CUHK Medical School, where I develop computation pipeline and machine learning approaches for cancer genomics under the supervision of [Prof. Xin WANG](https://xinwlab.netlify.app/). My research focuses on:

- **Tumor Heterogeneity Analysis** Tumor alternative splicing-induced protein isoform large-scale foldome analysis
- **Biomarker Discovery** through integrative multi-omics approaches
- **Clinical Predictive Modeling** with deep learning architectures
- **Computation-aided drug desgin** reconstruction algorithms and methods for computation-aided drug (molecules and antibody) screening and design

For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
